# Exploration-of-Cars24.com-data
I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on cars24.com dataset. The data was scrapped from the website using the Python Selenium library. A deep dive into this data showed great insights about used car market.
It provides detailed information about used cars, including their specifications and pricing details.

**AIM:**
This analysis aimed to find out the type of used cars people like to buy, cars that have good resale value, cars that have longevity, the average price of used cars over the years, do people prefer automatic cars to manual cars. The insight will help them identify models and brands of cars for targeted marketing and sales strategies, help them tailor their marketing campaign accordingly, and also track changes in pricing trends over time in the used car market.

**INSIGHTS**:
📍 "Maruti Swift" a sporty and agile hatchback is the most frequently listed and sought-after car model in the used car market.
📍 Analyzing the fuel column also reveals that "Petrol" is the predominant fuel type used by the cars listed on cars24. 80.01% of the cars listed on the site use petrol, 13.3% use diesel, and 6.67% use CNG. This insight indicates that the demand for Petrol cars is high.
📍 Over the years, Hatchback cars have traveled the highest distance and had the highest number of owners, followed by Sedan cars. This simply means that hatchback cars have longevity and a good resale value.
📍 Tracking the Average Price of cars by year shows that there has been a steady increase in car prices over the years. This analysis provides key performance metrics to track changes in pricing trends over time in the used car market.
📍 Analysis of the transmission column reveals that manual cars are the most listed and sought after, it made up 80.54% of the total cars.
📍 Cars with low mileage have fewer no owners and they cost more

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

📌 Focus on Petrol and Manual Cars: Since petrol cars make up 80.01% of the cars listed on cars24 and manual cars make up 80.54% of the total cars, it is clear that there is a significant demand for petrol cars in the used car market. They should emphasize showcasing petrol cars and highlight their advantages such as better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs. This can attract a larger pool of potential buyers and drive more sales.

📌 Consider Mileage and Number of Owners in Pricing Strategy:
The analysis revealed a correlation between mileage, the number of owners, and car prices. Cars with low mileage and fewer owners tend to command higher prices. They should take this into account when pricing their inventory.

📌 As hatchback cars have shown high demand and longevity, it would be wise to stock a variety of hatchback models (like Maruti Swift) to cater to the preferences of potential buyers.
